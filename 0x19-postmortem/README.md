Duration of the outage: The outage felt like an eternity, lasting approximately 2 hours, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM (UTC). It was like being stuck in a never-ending meeting with no coffee break in sight!
Impact: The primary service affected was our beloved task management system, turning it into a virtual ghost town where tasks were as elusive as a unicorn. Users experienced frustration levels soaring higher than Elon Musk's latest rocket launch. Approximately 50% of users were left wandering in the digital wilderness, unable to access or update tasks.
Timeline:

9:00 AM: The day started innocently enough until chaos ensued! Users began flooding our inboxes with panicked messages about missing tasks and broken dreams.
9:05 AM: Panic stations! Engineers sprang into action faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer, armed with their trusty keyboards and caffeinated beverages.
9:10 AM: Initial investigations revealed more mysteries than a Sherlock Holmes novel. Server logs resembled hieroglyphics, and our confidence plummeted faster than a skydiver without a parachute.
9:30 AM: We embarked on a wild goose chase through the labyrinth of server configurations, convinced that we were one step away from unraveling the mystery.
9:45 AM: Alas, our noble pursuit led us down the rabbit hole of network configurations, where every turn seemed to take us further from the light at the end of the tunnel.
10:00 AM: With the clock ticking louder than a time bomb, we sounded the alarm and escalated the incident to the infrastructure team, hoping for divine intervention.
10:30 AM: Eureka! Like a bolt of lightning from the heavens, the root cause revealed itselfâ€”a misconfiguration caused by a server change request gone awry!
11:00 AM: Victory! With the triumphant roar of a conquering hero, we vanquished the misconfiguration and restored order to the task management kingdom.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration, akin to a mischievous gremlin, stemmed from a recent server change request that left our system wandering in the digital wilderness.
Resolution: With the wisdom of Gandalf guiding us, we corrected the misconfiguration and restored peace to the realm, reconnecting to the correct server with the finesse of a seasoned wizard.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Tighten the reins on server change requests, ensuring they're as carefully scrutinized as a suspicious package at airport security.
Enhance communication channels between teams, akin to opening up the bat signal to ensure timely information exchange on critical matters.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of server configurations, dusting off cobwebs and banishing lurking misconfigurations to the digital abyss.
Implement automated checks to verify server connections, acting as a digital watchdog to sniff out misconfigurations before they wreak havoc.
Hold training sessions for team members, turning them into configuration wizards equipped to navigate the treacherous waters of server management.
